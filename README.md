Bitnix
======

A Linux distribution focused on having the user be able to use cgminer right out of the box (well, hopefully right out of the box...) in a command line interface that is user friendly.

Currently in developement. Check back for updates soon!

Also, I will be using this site to aid in development by putting files I might need to transfer to my work-in-progress from my computer that is running Xubuntu so that I may speed up the process.
